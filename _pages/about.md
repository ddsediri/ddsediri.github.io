I was formally trained as a physicist with a Master of Science degree from the University of Melbourne (2017) and a Bachelor of Science in Physics with minors in Mathematics and Computer Science (2013) from Hardin-Simmons University, Abilene, TX. I also completed a Master of Information Technology from Swinburne University, Melbourne in 2020. Most recently, I submitted my PhD thesis, focused on the use of neural encoder-decoder models for point cloud filtering/denoising, to Deakin University, Geelong. Shortly thereafter, I was appointed as a Research Fellow at the University of Western Australia in the group of Prof. Ajmal Mian.

My PhD work is on computer vision. More specifically, I work on applications of deep learning to point cloud processing, analysis and generation. I am also interested in the intersection between language and vision. 

**UPDATE:** Currently I am looking to supervise students interested in computer vision problems. Pre-requisites for scholarship applications include outstanding grades in your current Honours or Masters programs. Previous research outputs are also highly valued. Broadly speaking, potential projects will involve applying a variety of modelling approaches for transport problems (such as diffusion, normalizing flows etc.) for 3D generation. Other research avenues include blue-sky research applying 3D representation learning to other physical problems and/or developing new representation learning techniques.
